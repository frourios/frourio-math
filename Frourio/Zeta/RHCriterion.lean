/-- Phase 3.2: Core contradiction skeleton from an assumed off-critical zero.
This records the logical flow: extract the imaginary part τ₀, build a
golden-lattice sequence concentrating at τ₀, compare discrete and continuous
energies, and use the kernel–multiplicity bridge to reach a contradiction with
β ≠ 1/2. Analytical details are deferred. -/

  -- Step 1: construct a golden test sequence concentrating at τ₀ on the line σ=1/2

  have hbridge := kernel_multiplicity_bridge (1/2) F
  -- Step 4: combine the above with the off-critical hypothesis (placeholder) to contradict hβ
  -- Details: use that Kζ(τ₀)=0 via the zero hypothesis to force small energy from hconc,
  -- nonnegativity and bridge to infer multiplicity constraints incompatible with β ≠ 1/2.

available, conclude `RH` from the Frourio–Weil criterion. Currently, `RH` is a
placeholder `True`, so the result follows immediately; the reference to
`off_critical_contradiction_proof` documents the intended argumentative link. -/
