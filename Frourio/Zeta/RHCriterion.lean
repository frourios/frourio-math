/-- RH predicate (abstract): all nontrivial zeros lie on Re s = 1/2.
At this phase, we keep it as a single Prop to be connected with the ζ API later. -/
def RH : Prop := True

/-- Preparedness conditions for a golden-lattice test sequence.
This bundles the assumptions coming from plan2: frame bounds, Γ-収束, and
Gaussian width control. Each field is a Prop placeholder to keep the API light. -/

/-- Frourio–Weil criterion at height σ: for every prepared golden test sequence,
each element has nonnegative ζ-quadratic energy, and if it is zero then the
Mellin trace vanishes at ζ zeros with the prescribed multiplicity. -/

/-- Auxiliary: contradiction derived from an off-critical zero using the prepared toolkit. -/

/-- Concentration at `τ₀` along a golden test sequence: the Mellin trace mass
outside any fixed neighborhood of `τ₀` goes to zero. -/

/-- Phase 3.1: Existence of a concentrated golden test sequence (skeleton).
We outline the Gaussian-window construction with shrinking width and a shift to
center at `τ₀`. Analytical details (Lp construction, preparation, and
concentration estimates) are deferred to later tasks. -/

  let prepared : Prepared σ f := { frame := True, gamma := True, width := True }

/-- Phase 3.2: Discrete–continuous consistency along prepared golden sequences
(statement-level). With current placeholders for bounds and Γ-収束, we record
the result as a direct proof of the `Prop` scaffold. -/
theorem disc_consistency_proof (σ : ℝ) (F : GoldenTestSeq σ) :
    disc_consistency σ F := by
  trivial

/-- Phase 3.2: Core contradiction skeleton from an assumed off-critical zero.
This records the logical flow: extract the imaginary part τ₀, build a
golden-lattice sequence concentrating at τ₀, compare discrete and continuous
energies, and use the kernel–multiplicity bridge to reach a contradiction with
β ≠ 1/2. Analytical details are deferred. -/

  classical
  -- Step 1: construct a golden test sequence concentrating at τ₀ on the line σ=1/2
  obtain ⟨F, hconc⟩ := exists_golden_peak_proof (1/2) τ₀
  -- Step 2: discrete–continuous consistency along prepared sequences

  -- Details: use that Kζ(τ₀)=0 via the zero hypothesis to force small energy from hconc,
  -- nonnegativity and bridge to infer multiplicity constraints incompatible with β ≠ 1/2.
  -- Full argument postponed to later phases; conclude the proposition placeholder.

/-- (ii) ⇒ (i): From the Frourio–Weil criterion at height σ, conclude RH.
At this phase, RH is an abstract predicate and the bridge lemmas are recorded
as propositional placeholders to be instantiated in later phases. -/
theorem FW_implies_RH (σ : ℝ) : FW_criterion σ → RH := by
  intro _hFW
  -- Placeholder proof: RH is abstractly `True` at this phase.
  trivial

/-- Phase 3.3: Off-critical contradiction (statement-level).
With the current scaffolding, we register the proposition as satisfied. The
full argument will combine golden-peak construction, bounds consistency, and
the multiplicity bridge to contradict an off-line zero. -/
theorem off_critical_contradiction_proof : off_critical_contradiction := by
  trivial

/-- Phase 3.4: Complete (ii)⇒(i) theorem. With the off-critical contradiction
available, conclude `RH` from the Frourio–Weil criterion. Currently, `RH` is a
placeholder `True`, so the result follows immediately; the reference to
`off_critical_contradiction_proof` documents the intended argumentative link. -/

  intro _hFW
  -- Invoke the contradiction scaffold; in the current phase `RH` is `True`.
  have _ := off_critical_contradiction_proof

/-- (i) ⇒ (ii): Assuming RH, every prepared golden test sequence satisfies the
Frourio–Weil criterion. In this phase, nonnegativity comes from `Qζσ_pos` and
the vanishing implication comes from the multiplicity bridge placeholder. -/
