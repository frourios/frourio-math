At this phase, we keep it as a single Prop to be connected with the ζ API later. -/

/-- Preparedness conditions for a golden-lattice test sequence.
This bundles the assumptions coming from plan2: frame bounds, Γ-収束, and
Gaussian width control. Each field is a Prop placeholder to keep the API light. -/

each element has nonnegative ζ-quadratic energy, and if it is zero then the
Mellin trace vanishes at ζ zeros with the prescribed multiplicity. -/

outside any fixed neighborhood of `τ₀` goes to zero. -/

We instantiate the zero sequence, whose Mellin trace vanishes identically, hence
trivially concentrates at any target `τ₀`. -/

/-- (ii) ⇒ (i): From the Frourio–Weil criterion at height σ, conclude RH.
At this phase, RH is an abstract predicate and the bridge lemmas are recorded
as propositional placeholders to be instantiated in later phases. -/

  intro _hFW
  -- Placeholder proof: RH is abstractly `True` at this phase.
  trivial

/-- Phase 3.3: Off-critical contradiction (statement-level).
With the current scaffolding, we register the proposition as satisfied. The
full argument will combine golden-peak construction, bounds consistency, and
the multiplicity bridge to contradict an off-line zero. -/

  trivial

/-- Phase 3.4: Complete (ii)⇒(i) theorem. With the off-critical contradiction
available, conclude `RH` from the Frourio–Weil criterion. Currently, `RH` is a
placeholder `True`, so the result follows immediately; the reference to
`off_critical_contradiction_proof` documents the intended argumentative link. -/

(statement-level). With current placeholders for bounds and Γ-収束, we record
the result as a direct proof of the `Prop` scaffold. -/

/-- (i) ⇒ (ii): Assuming RH, every prepared golden test sequence satisfies the
Frourio–Weil criterion. In this phase, nonnegativity comes from `Qζσ_pos` and
the vanishing implication comes from the multiplicity bridge placeholder. -/
