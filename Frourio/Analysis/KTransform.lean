FG8 A3: K-transform skeleton and basic model

This module introduces a lightweight `KTransform` structure capturing the
multi-point transform `𝒦_σ` as a map into (signed) kernels on `ℝ` together
with minimal predicates representing (K1′) narrow continuity and (K4^m)
geodesic affinity. A 1D basic model is provided to serve as a concrete
instance. The design remains proof-light and avoids measure-theoretic load.

section X
variable {X : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace X]

/-- K-transform: a map attaching to each state `x : X` a kernel on `ℝ`.
The payload is an arbitrary function `ℝ → ℝ` at this phase. -/
structure KTransform (X : Type*) [PseudoMetricSpace X] where
  (map : X → ℝ → ℝ)
  (narrowContinuous : Prop)

/-- (K1′) surrogate: narrow continuity predicate. -/
def K1primeK (K : KTransform X) : Prop := K.narrowContinuous

/-- (K4^m) surrogate: geodesic affinity predicate (placeholder). -/
def K4mK (_K : KTransform X) : Prop := True

/-- Auxiliary predicate: a uniform lower bound for the kernel at `s = 0`.
This lightweight surrogate is used to produce coercivity-style bounds for
`Dσm` when building the functional layer. -/
def UniformLowerBoundAtZero (K : KTransform X) (C0 : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : X, K.map x 0 ≥ -C0

/-- Interface: build `Dσm` from a `KTransform` and a supplied sup-norm bound.
We keep it algebraic via a simple evaluation `map x 0`, scaled by `Ssup`. -/
noncomputable def DsigmamFromK (K : KTransform X) (Ssup : ℝ) : X → ℝ :=
  fun x => Ssup * K.map x 0

/-! 1D basic model (log isometry surrogate):
We provide a trivial kernel and record that (K1′) and (K4^m) hold by
construction at this phase. -/

theorem K4mK_basic1D : K4mK (KTransform.basic1D) := by

/-- In the 1D basic model, the kernel at `s = 0` is exactly `0`, hence admits
the uniform lower bound with `C0 = 0`. -/
