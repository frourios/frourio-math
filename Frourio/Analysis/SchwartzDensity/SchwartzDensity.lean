/-- Truncated Lp functions are integrable with respect to volume measure -/
lemma lp_truncation_integrable {σ : ℝ} (hσ_lower : 1 / 2 < σ) (hσ_upper : σ < 3 / 2)
    (s : Lp ℂ 2 (weightedMeasure σ)) (R : ℝ) (hR_pos : 0 < R) :
    Integrable (fun x => if 0 < x ∧ x ≤ R then (s : ℝ → ℂ) x else 0) volume := by
  -- For σ ∈ (1/2, 3/2), Cauchy-Schwarz gives integrability of truncations on (0,R]
  -- Key insight: ∫_{(0,R]} |s(x)| dx ≤
  --   (∫ |s(x)|² x^{2σ-1} dx/x)^{1/2} (∫_{(0,R]} x^{1-2σ} dx)^{1/2}
  -- The first factor is finite since s ∈ L²(weightedMeasure σ)
  -- The second factor ∫_{(0,R]} x^{1-2σ} dx is finite when 1-2σ > -1, i.e., σ < 1
  -- But we need σ > 1/2 for the weighted measure, so we restrict to σ < 3/2 for safety
  -- Without σ < 3/2, counterexamples exist (e.g., s(x) = 1/x for x > 0)

/-- Positive truncation of Lp function is also in Lp for weighted measure -/
lemma positive_truncation_memLp {σ : ℝ} (s : Lp ℂ 2 (weightedMeasure σ)) (R : ℝ) :
    MemLp (fun x => if 0 < x ∧ x ≤ R then (s : ℝ → ℂ) x else 0) 2 (weightedMeasure σ) := by
  -- Since the positive truncation only differs from the original truncation on non-positive reals,

    eLpNorm ((s : ℝ → ℂ) - s_R) 2 (weightedMeasure σ) < ENNReal.ofReal ε := by
  -- Since s_R only differs from the original truncation on non-positive reals,

    Continuous (fun x => ∫ y, f y * φ (x - y) ∂volume) := by
  -- Standard convolution continuity theorem
  -- For integrable f and smooth compact φ, the convolution f * φ is continuous
  -- This follows from the dominated convergence theorem:
  -- As h → 0, (f * φ)(x + h) - (f * φ)(x) = ∫ f(y) * [φ(x + h - y) - φ(x - y)] dy
  -- Since φ is smooth and has compact support, φ(x + h - y) - φ(x - y) → 0 uniformly
  -- And |f(y) * [φ(x + h - y) - φ(x - y)]| ≤ 2|f(y)| sup|φ| which is integrable
  -- By dominated convergence, the convolution is continuous
  sorry -- Standard convolution continuity result

    MemLp (fun x => ∫ y, f y * φ (x - y) ∂volume) 2 (weightedMeasure σ) := by
  -- Convolution of L² function with smooth compact kernel preserves L² membership
  -- This follows from Young's convolution inequality:
  -- For f ∈ L²(μ) and φ ∈ L¹ ∩ L∞ with compact support, f * φ ∈ L²(μ)
  -- In our case, φ is smooth and compactly supported, so φ ∈ L¹ ∩ L∞
  -- The weighted measure weightedMeasure σ has polynomial growth, so the convolution
  -- preserves L² integrability with appropriate bounds
  -- Key insight: |f * φ|(x) ≤ ‖φ‖_∞ ∫ |f(y)| dy over compact support of φ

/-- Distance bound from truncation error for Lp elements -/

  -- The distance between Lp elements equals the L² norm of their function difference
  -- dist s (hs_R_memLp.toLp s_R) = ‖s - hs_R_memLp.toLp s_R‖_L²
  -- Since hs_R_memLp.toLp s_R represents s_R as an Lp element,
  -- we have ‖s - hs_R_memLp.toLp s_R‖_L² = ‖(s : ℝ → ℂ) - s_R‖_L²
  -- By assumption, eLpNorm ((s : ℝ → ℂ) - s_R) 2 (weightedMeasure σ) < ENNReal.ofReal ε

/-- Mollification error bound for L² functions with weighted measure -/

    dist (hf_memLp.toLp f) (hg_memLp.toLp g) < ε / 2 := by
  -- Mollification error bound using continuity and smoothness of the kernel
  -- For small δ, the convolution g = f * φ approximates f well in L² norm
  -- This follows from standard mollification theory:
  -- As δ → 0, φ_δ(x) = (1/δ) φ(x/δ) approaches the Dirac delta
  -- So f * φ_δ → f in L² as δ → 0
  -- For finite δ, the error is controlled by δ and the smoothness of φ
  -- In weighted L² spaces, the polynomial weight doesn't affect the local approximation
  sorry -- Standard mollification approximation bound in weighted L² spaces

/-- Truncated Lp functions are locally integrable with respect to volume measure -/
lemma lp_truncation_locally_integrable {σ : ℝ} (hσ : 1 / 2 < σ)
    (s : Lp ℂ 2 (weightedMeasure σ)) (R : ℝ) (hR_pos : 0 < R) :

  -- The truncated function has compact support (bounded by R)
  -- and comes from an L² function in weighted measure
  -- Functions with compact support are locally integrable w.r.t. volume measure
  -- This follows because on any bounded set, the truncated function is bounded
