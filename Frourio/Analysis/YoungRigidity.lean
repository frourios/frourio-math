FG8 A6: Young rigidity — statement module

This module provides statement-level containers for a Young-type inequality
between L² and TV, and an equality (rigidity) condition. It intentionally
avoids analytic details and measure-theoretic burdens; the goal is to fix
API shapes that later phases can refine with concrete proofs.
