/-- If the norm is bounded by C, then the squared norm is bounded by C^2 -/

/-- For any fixed radius, there exists a bound on the zeta function -/
lemma zeta_bounded_on_radius (R₀ : ℝ) : ∃ C₀ : ℝ,
    ∀ τ : ℝ, |τ| ≤ R₀ → ‖ZetaLineAPI.zeta_on_line τ‖ ≤ C₀ := by
  -- This follows directly from ZetaLineAPI.loc_bounded

  -- This is a heuristic bound assuming linear growth
  -- We claim C' ≤ C + (R' - R) + 1, which would give the desired inequality

  -- We now have C and C' are non-negative from the assumptions

  -- The key inequality we need: C' ≤ C + R' - R + 1
  -- This assumes at most linear growth, which is reasonable for zeta on the critical line
  have h_linear_growth : C' ≤ C + (R' - R) + 1 := by
    -- This is the assumption about zeta growth that we cannot prove from the API alone
    -- It states that the bound grows at most linearly with the radius

    -- Known provable results:
    -- - Convexity bound: |ζ(1/2 + it)| = O(t^{1/4})
    -- - This would give C' ≤ C_0 * (R')^{1/4} for some absolute constant C_0

    -- What we CANNOT use (unproven):
    -- - Lindelöf hypothesis: would give O(t^ε) for any ε > 0
    -- - Riemann hypothesis: would also give strong bounds

    -- Our assumption of linear growth C' ≤ C + (R' - R) + 1 is:
    -- - Stronger than what's proven (convexity gives t^{1/4})
    -- - But necessary for the proof structure to work

    sorry -- Requires growth assumption beyond current knowledge

  -- Now square both sides and use the fact that (a + b)^2 ≤ 2(a^2 + b^2) for a simpler bound

  -- Since R' - R = |τ| + 1 - 1000 ≤ |τ| - 999
  -- and |τ| > 1000 (from h : ¬|τ| ≤ R), we have R' - R > 0
  -- But for the bound we're using, (R' - R)^2 is absorbed in the +1
