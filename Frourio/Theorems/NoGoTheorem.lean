D9: No-Go / approximate binarization (skeleton)

We formalize a light statement-only scaffold for the m=2 No-Go result.
The content is expressed via a problem record and a statement that under
the stated assumptions, exact binarization is impossible.

/-- Abstract binarization problem data for an `m`-point operator. -/
structure BinarizationProblem where
  (m : ℕ)
  (law_exact : Prop)      -- target exact binarization law to be ruled out
  (assumptions : Prop)    -- hypotheses (regularity/symmetry/etc.)

/-- No-Go theorem skeleton: for `m = 2`, the exact law does not hold under
the provided assumptions. -/
def noGoTheorem_m2 (P : BinarizationProblem) : Prop :=
  (P.m = 2 ∧ P.assumptions) → ¬ P.law_exact
